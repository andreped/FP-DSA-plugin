**DISCLAIMER:** This is a work in progress. When I have the plugin properly working and stable, I will make a public docker image, and make a release here.

Note that this setup has been tested against Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04. It should likely work on Windows 10, but on macOS there is a conflict between OpenGL/OpenCL resulting in a `RuntimeError: clGetPlatformIDs`.

Click `watch` in the top right if this project interests you and want to be updated when it is ready to be tested.

## üéä Features

The software is still in development, but some key features have been added such as:

* Uses pyFAST backend to run FAST pipelines (FPLs)
* Developed generic backend tool for running FPLs through the UI and convert predictions to the JSON format
* Ability to run patch-wise classification and segmentation models
* Render classification predictions as heatmaps and segmentation objects as boundaries
* Store predictions in database, access, download, and modify these through the UI


## üê≥ Requirements

DSA needs to be installed. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/DigitalSlideArchive/digital_slide_archive/tree/master/devops/dsa) on how to do so.

In addition, docker need to be setup such that it works with pyFAST. For that I strongly recommend installing Docker desktop. You might also need to install the nvidia docker to make it work properly:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2
sudo systemctl restart docker
```


## üíª Installation

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/andreped/FP-dsa-plugin.git
```

Build the docker image for the plugin:
```
cd dsa/
docker build -t fastpathology .
```

To add the plugin to DSA, choose `Upload new Task` under `Slicer CLI Web Tasks` in the DSA web UI, and write `fastpathology:latest` and click `Import image`. The plugin can then be used from the Analysis Page.


## üëè Acknowledgements

The core was built based on [pyFAST](https://github.com/smistad/FAST), and the plugin was inspired by the plugins made for [MONAILabel](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel/tree/main/plugins/dsa) and [HistomicsTK](https://github.com/DigitalSlideArchive/HistomicsTK/tree/master/histomicstk/cli). Conversion of pyFAST's pyramidal TIFF annotations to HistomicsTK's JSON annotations was enabled using [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv).

The plugin was made for the [Digital Slide Archive](https://github.com/DigitalSlideArchive/digital_slide_archive) which has developed an open and extremely robust and user-friendly web solution for archiving, visualizing, processing, and annotating large microscopy images. Building our methods on top of DSA was done with ease and credit to the developers such as [manthey](https://github.com/manthey) and [dgutman](https://github.com/dgutman) for addressing any issue and concerns we had at impressive speed!


## ‚ú® License
